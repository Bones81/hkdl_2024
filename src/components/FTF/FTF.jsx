          Welcome, carolers! This is a reference website intended for newbies
          and vets alike to help you learn (or remember) what this contract
          requires of us and what it offers!
        </p>
        <p>
          First off,{" "}
          <b>
            <em>congratulations</em>
          </b>{" "}
          on earning this contract. Almost everyone who has done it considers it
          a highlight of their career and life. Hong Kong is an amazing city,
          and the people are equally amazing. There are too many great aspects
          of this contract to possibly cover in one place!
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll have <b>A HUGE AMOUNT</b> of information thrown at you between
          now and the end of the contract, and the hope is that this site
          collects and organizes as much of that info as possible.
        </p>
        <h3 className="special-note">
          I've done my best to update everything on this site for 2023. That
          said, you may well encounter information that is leftover from 2022,
          or possibly even earlier. If anything seems out-of-date, it may well
          be. Let your friendly webmaster Nathan know if anything is clearly
          inaccurate.

          , this site is in no way an official Disney or Goode Time resource or
          stamped with anyone's seal of approval. It is merely an attempt by
          previous HKDL carolers to consolidate and digest the massive amount of
          information and advice we receive related to this contract. If this
          site's info conflicts with any official Disney or Goode Time info,
          please prioritize what Disney or Goode Time says. Everything is
