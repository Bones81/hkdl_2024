        <h3>Costumes</h3>
        <p>
          Every costume item is provided by Disney. You will not be required to
          bring any costume items of your own.
        </p>
        <h4>Prop note: Pitchpipes</h4>
        <p>
          If you own a pitchpipe (or two), pack them. Goode Time (and Disney)
          traditionally expect one of the boys to handle pitchpipe duties during
          performance. Ideally, each group has at least two pitchpipes
          available, in case one goes missing, is left in a costume pocket
          accidentally, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Makeup/Hair</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone will, at some point, have to do a makeup and hair
          consultation. Historically, the consultant looks at the men and says,
          "You don't need to do anything except put a little product in your
          hair" before turning attention to the women.
        </p>
        <p>
          The returning ladies can shed more light on the hair and makeup
          situation. I know mostly that it requires significant time investment
          each day and that you will all become great friends with the hair
          team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ladies will likely have to prep their hair for wigs whenever we sing
          carols. And then a Disney stylist will help with your hair for the
          Tree Lighting show.
