          ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è By this point, all of us should have received,
          signed, and completed our contracts and mailed off our visa
          application materials to Fragomen, the agency handling our immigration
          cases. The visas take 4-6 weeks to process and approve, and as of this
          update (9/13/23), in 6 weeks it will be the Wednesday before we start
          our contract. And, of course, we must have approved visas by
          then!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

            In the work <strong>visa application</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>contract</strong> completion process, you will be asked to
            submit many documents: some as digital files, others as hard copies,
            and some in both forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will likely have to submit documents to both HKDL's¬†HR
            department and a company called Fragomen that helps us get our work
            visas from the Immigration Dept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, when you FedEx your visa application materials to HK,
            make sure you <em>save your receipt(s)</em>, and make sure you{" "}
            <em>bring those receipts with you to HK</em> so that Disney can
            reimburse you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a cheat sheet to help you collect the appropriate paperwork,
            even before you receive the official emails from HK Disney's HR
            peeps requesting all these items. Especially for newbies, it may
            take a hot minute to collect everything, so I recommend starting to
            collect these materials now so that you have them somewhat ready
            when it's time to mail them or email them. You'll have to plan for
            at least 4-6 weeks processing time from the date you mail off your
            visa application materials.

            As of 2022, Hong Kong has been issuing digital e-visas instead of
            mailing us hard copies. These e-visas come with a QR code you should
            print and also save digitally.

            Additionally, as of 2022, HKDL now allows you to complete your
            contract signing electronically. You may still need to print a hard
            copy of the signed contract to include with your visa application.
