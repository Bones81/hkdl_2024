        <h3>Flight info</h3>
        <p>
          HKDL has historically waited until the last week -- and sometimes even
          the last 72 hours -- to give us our flight information. It may feel a
          bit nerve-wracking to be inching closer to the flight date without any
          itinerary, but just know the flight info will show up!
        </p>
        <p>
          Because HK Disney has indicated the two groups will have different
          contract start dates, and because our flights are usually 1-2 days
          before the contract start date, the following scenario is likely:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Group 1 (Katie, Emilia, Nathan, Sean): Flight date Oct 28 or 29,
            contract start Oct 30.
          </li>
          <li>
            Group 2 (Sarah, Chelsea, Omar, Johnny): Flight date Nov 4 or 5,
            contract start Nov 6.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          During the pandemic contracts, they were careful to connect all of us
          to the same Hong Kong flight, even though we come from all over the
          US. However, now that pandemic precautions are ended, I suspect
          they'll go back to the old system, where they would just have the
          group arrive to Hong Kong within a couple hours of each other and have
          Irene or someone from HR greet us in the airport arrivals hall, give
          us a welcome packet, and then set us up with taxis to HPRC. They would
          often time our arrival with additional expat face characters also
          starting their contracts. They'll let us know the plan, but it may not
          be until the week we are scheduled to depart.

        <h3>Change your seat!</h3>
        <p>
          You may be able to change your seat to one you prefer. May as well be
          as comfortable as possible for the long flight(s)! Use the "Airline
          Booking Ref" from your flight email (as seen in the pic below) to
          search for your itinerary.

        <h3>Baggage</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on what airline you are on, you usually get two
          complimentary checked bags up to 50lbs, as well as 1 bag + 1 personal
          item to carry on (total carry-on weight 22lbs). The fees are often
          hefty for exceeding the weight limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have usually traveled with 2 checked rolling suitcases/bags, a
          medium-sized duffle bag, and a medium-sized backpack. It's basically
          as much as I can handle by myself. But remember, you can buy just
          about ANYTHING in HK, so if you don't need it, leave it at home.
          Number one rule of traveling: don't overpack.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is always possible that a checked bag could get lost, so it is
          extremely useful to have a full complement of essential clothes, food,
          chargers/power, and entertainment in your carry-on luggage.
        </p>
        <h3>In-Flight Meals</h3>
        <p>
          Be sure to check with your airline to arrange any special meals you
          may need/want.
        </p>
        <h3>Frequent Flier program</h3>
        <p>
          A flight to HK is a huge number of miles! Take advantage of your
          airline's frequent flier program and ensure that your flight(s) counts
          toward your miles!
        </p>
