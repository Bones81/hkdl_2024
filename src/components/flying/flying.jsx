        <h3>Flight info</h3>
        <p>
          HKDL has historically waited until the last week -- and sometimes even
          the last 48-72 hours -- to give us our flight information. It may feel a
          bit nerve-wracking to be inching closer to the flight date without any
          itinerary, but just know the flight info will show up!
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe all 12 of us have the same contract start date, Monday, October 28th. Our flights will very likely be scheduled for Saturday, October 26th. Historically, they try to have everyone arrive in Hong Kong in the mid-afternoon/evening of the night before your contract officially begins. For us that means, we will likely all arrive in Hong Kong in the mid-afternoon/evening on Sunday, October 27th. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, they were careful to connect all of us
          to the same Hong Kong flight, even though we come from all over the
          US. However, I suspect they may go back to the old system, where they would just have all of us arrive in Hong Kong within a couple hours of each other and have
          Irene or someone from HR greet us in the airport arrivals hall, give
          us a welcome packet, and then set us up with taxis to our hotel. They would
          often time our arrival with additional expat face characters also
          starting their contracts. They'll let us know the plan, but it may not
          be until the week we are scheduled to depart.

        <h3>Change your seat!</h3>
        <p>
          You may be able to change your seat to one you prefer. May as well be
          as comfortable as possible for the long flight(s)! Use the "Airline
          Booking Ref" from your flight email (as seen in the pic below) to
          search for your itinerary.

        <h3>Baggage</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on what airline you are on, you usually get two
          complimentary checked bags up to 50lbs, as well as 1 bag + 1 personal
          item to carry on (total carry-on weight 22lbs). The fees are often
          hefty for exceeding the weight limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have usually traveled with 2 checked rolling suitcases/bags, a
          medium-sized duffle bag, and a medium-sized backpack. It's basically
          as much as I can handle by myself. But remember, you can buy just
          about ANYTHING in HK, so if you don't need it, leave it at home.
          Number one rule of traveling: don't overpack.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is always possible that a checked bag could get lost, so it is
          extremely useful to have a full complement of essential clothes, food,
          chargers/power, and entertainment in your carry-on luggage.
        </p>
        <h3>In-Flight Meals</h3>
        <p>
          Be sure to check with your airline to arrange any special meals you
          may need/want.
        </p>
        <h3>Frequent Flier program</h3>
        <p>
          A flight to HK is a huge number of miles! Take advantage of your
          airline's frequent flier program and ensure that your flight(s) counts
          toward your miles!
