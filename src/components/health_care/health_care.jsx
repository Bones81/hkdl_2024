          Our Disney-provided health insurance is supposed to be pretty high
          quality. I know one previous
          caroler had to get a root canal done in HK. And another had multiple
          outpatient visits to local hospitals for rough illnesses during a
          contract.

          In 2023, some pretty rough illnesses spread through the dancers and vocalists at HKDL. Unfortunately, despite taking many precautions, pretty much all of us dealt with some version of the illness, and a few of us did have to take sick days off of work.
        </p>
        <p>A doctor's note is required to clear your sick days. As a result, even though you may feel pretty awful, you need to visit a local clinic with a doctor who takes our insurance. Fortunately there were a couple of clinics about a 10-minute walk from our HPRC housing. I will try to post their info here so that we can be aware of them should we need them this year.</p>
        <p>The doctor's visits were ultimately very efficient, with the doctor asking a few questions to determine the nature of the illness, followed by issuing the doctor's note and several different meds targeting any and all symptoms. With our insurance, there was HKD$0 for all services.</p>
        <p>
          As part of our first couple of weeks at Disney, we will eventually
          receive a packet with our health insurance benefits and information.
          We will receive a health insurance card at some point too. And we are
          expected to turn it in at the end of the contract. I'm fairly certain
          our insurance covers full medical and dental services.
        </p>
        <p>
          One form we will receive and be advised to fill out is a Beneficiary
          form. It's basically a form that identifies who gets your benefits if
          you die under our insurance policy. There is a drop bin for the form
          by the Disney mailroom in 602 (the main administrative building for
          HKDL). But it is not a critical form, given the high unlikelihood of
          us dying. I often lose track of it before the end of the contract.
