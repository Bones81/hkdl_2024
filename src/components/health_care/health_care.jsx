          Our Disney-provided health insurance is supposed to be pretty high
          quality. I have not personally ever used it. I know one previous
          caroler had to get a root canal done in HK. And another had multiple
          outpatient visits to local hospitals for rough illnesses during a
          contract. If anyone is able to offer more information on the
          experience of using our health insurance in HK, let me know, and we'll
          add it to this section.

          As part of our first couple of weeks at Disney, we will eventually
          receive a packet with our health insurance benefits and information.
          We will receive a health insurance card at some point too. And we are
          expected to turn it in at the end of the contract. I'm fairly certain
          our insurance covers full medical and dental services.

          One form we will receive and be advised to fill out is a Beneficiary
          form. It's basically a form that identifies who gets your benefits if
          you die under our insurance policy. There is a drop bin for the form
          by the Disney mailroom in 602 (the main administrative building for
          HKDL). But it is not a critical form, given the high unlikelihood of
          us dying. I often lose track of it before the end of the contract.
