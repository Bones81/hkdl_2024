          We are assigned our own studio-style "serviced apartment." It usually
          has:
          <ul>
            <li>a queen-size bed (that is VERY firm)</li>
            <li>a modestly supplied kitchenette with two electric burners</li>
            <li>a microwave</li>
            <li>a sink</li>
            <li>a half-size refrigerator</li>
            <li>a Western-style bathroom with a bathtub and shower</li>
            <li>a small dining table</li>
            <li>a small couch/sitting area</li>
            <li>a television, ~32", with HDMI input and local channels</li>
            <li>a wifi router</li>
            <li>a large closet</li>
            <li>a small night table on either side of the bed</li>
            <li>a small vanity nook/area</li>
            <li>
              a varying number of cabinets, drawers, and other surfaces,
              depending on the room
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          "Serviced Apartment" basically means that you get hotel-style
          housekeeping twice a week on the same days each week, for example,
          always on Tuesdays and Saturdays. They will empty your trash, clean
          your bathroom/shower area, make your bed, and vacuum, but they will
          NOT do your dishes!
        </p>

          The video above shows an example of how your room might be set up.
          There are a few different layouts you could have in your HPRC room. It
          just depends on the room's location in the hotel's floorplan. But, for
          the most part, the rooms look like what you see in the video. That
          said, this one was among the smaller rooms I've had at HPRC.
