        <ul className="leisure-ul">
          <li>
            Central - As the name implies, this district is 'central' to just
            about everything that happens in HK. Central is located on the
            southern side of Victoria Harbour, across from TST. It contains a
            transportation hub, government buildings, banks, restaurants/bars,
            cultural hotspots, street markets, trendy shopping, fancy
            hotels...basically one of HK's two "downtowns," with TST being the
            other.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tsim Sha Tsui, aka TST - loads of fun to be had in TST. Plus, our
            hotel offers a cheap, frequent shuttle that takes you directly
            to/from the district.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wan Chai/Causeway Bay - Wan Chai has some 'edgier' bars and
            restaurants, and Causeway Bay is a shopping/food epicenter. It even
            has its own "Times Square."
          </li>
          <li>
            Ocean Park - the other theme park in Hong Kong: part amusement park,
            part zoo, and part aquarium!
          </li>

          <li>
            Stanley - a neighborhood in the extreme southeastern part of HK that
            has great ocean views, promenades, shopping, restaurants, and a
            prison museum
          </li>
          <li>Lamma Island</li>
          <li>Cheung Chau Island</li>
          <li>Tai O fishing village</li>
          <li>
            Sai Kung - a beautiful region in the extreme northeast part of HK
            featuring beaches, epic hikes, and a lively port neighborhood
          </li>
          <li>
            Day trip to Macau - This one involves leaving HK, and I am hopeful
            we can do it this year! 🤞 Macau is the Vegas of the East. Walk a
            casino floor, have a Portuguese egg tart (or seven), and see The
            House of Dancing Water, one of the most amazing shows you'll ever
            see.

        <h3>HK is one giant mall after another.</h3>
        <ul className="leisure-ul">

          <li>Flower Market/Bird Market</li>
          <li>
            Basically every metro station is connected to a mall because the
            malls and the public transportation are owned by the same entity, or
            so I have heard.

            Ned Kelly's Last Stand - the bandleader, Colin, is one of our best
            friends in HK. The man loves music and will probably come to see us
            perform at Disney at some point. Hopefully we can go early and often
            to Ned Kelly's to see his band play. Some of our favorites nights of
            the whole contract have occurred at Ned's. He'll even let you get up
            and sing a jazz standard with the band. And we've been known to
            serenade the bar with a few Christmas carols during their Christmas
            big band show.

        <h3>Celebrating Holidays</h3>
        <h4 className="holiday-title">Halloween 🎃</h4>
        <p>
          Those carolers who start work on Oct. 30 will get to see HKDL with all
          its Halloween decor. Sadly, they will promptly tear down that decor
          and start preparing for Christmas decorations on Nov. 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          However! The HKDL Halloween season show "Let's Get Wicked" should be
          extended through early Nov., so hopefully we'll all be able to see it!
          It's held in the Theater in the Wild where The Festival of the Lion
          King show runs for the majority of the year. (We should be able to see
          LK as well after it reopens in late Nov. or early Dec.)
        </p>
        <img
          className="list-pic"
          src="../src/assets/halloween_2020.jpeg"
          alt="Halloween 2020"

        {/* <p>We are often invited to a Halloween party. Often, we just hold our own so that we aren't out partying far from home.</p>
                <p>Trick-or-Treating is not so much a thing in Hong Kong, but that doesn't have to stop us from tricking-or-treating with each other! </p>
                <p>Halloween spirit may be quite suppressed this year, at the park especially (since all the Halloween shows were cancelled). Again, that doesn't have to stop us if we want to celebrate a little.</p> */}
        <h4 className="holiday-title">Thanksgiving 🦃</h4>
        <img
          className="list-pic"
          src="../src/assets/thanksgiving_2020.jpeg"
          alt="Thanksgiving 2020"
        />
        <p className="img-caption">

        </p>
        <p>
          We have historically coordinated a group Thanksgiving get-together. In
          2019, we even included our stage managers who brought fun local foods
          and desserts to add to the potluck dinner.
        </p>
        <img
          className="list-pic"
          src="../src/assets/Thanksgiving 2019.jpg"
          alt="Thanksgiving 2019"
        />
        <p>
          Everyone chooses a classic Thanksgiving item (or two) to contribute.
          Given the lack of ovens, the main course has been either IKEA
          meatballs or KFC! But all the other usual classics have appeared:
          mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing, sweet potatoes, mini
          pumpkin pies, green beans, brussels sprouts, wine, cocktails, etc.!
        </p>
        <p>
          With 8 of us again this year, perhaps we can resurrect this caroler
          tradition. That said, there's no shame at all in letting someone else
          do the cooking and the dishes. In 2022 we went to Hai Di Lao Hot Pot
          and had an absolute feast!
        </p>
        <h4 className="holiday-title">Christmas 🎁</h4>
        <p>
          By the time Christmas rolls around, we are usually pretty pooped. We
          have historically worked six-day (overtime) weeks during the two weeks
          leading up to Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have always done small group gifts for the stage managers from the
          carolers, and in 2020 we did a secret Santa white elephant gift
          exchange with each other. But there's certainly no pressure or
          expectation. Some years we would coordinate to have Christmas lunch
          together at one of the park's restaurants and take advantage of our
          cast member holiday coupons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all likelihood, we will be working on Christmas Day, which falls on
          a Monday this year (2023).
        </p>
        <h4 className="holiday-title">New Year's Eve 🎉🥂🎉</h4>
        <p>
          New Year's celebrating is going to be very tough this year, as Jan 1
          is our last day of work. In all likelihood, we will all be packing and
          tying up whatever last ends remain so that we will be able to depart
          as smoothly as possible on Jan 2. Nonetheless, some have managed to
          enjoy New Year's Eve celebrations despite juggling work and
          end-of-contract obligations. I have rung in several new years with
          Colin and the band at Ned Kelly's Last Stand. Last year, Sean went on
          a cruise in Victoria Harbour while the rest of us stayed home and
          played Nintendo Switch! How you celebrate New Year's will be entirely
          up to you as the priority will be ensuring that you are ready to
          depart Hong Kong less than 48 hours later.
