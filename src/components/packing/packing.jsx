          Many of these items you can also purchase in HK, but consider packing
          your own if you'd rather have the item from the start of the contract
          and don't mind the extra weight in your luggage.
        </h4>
        <ul className="packing-ul">
          <li>Kitchen towels/dish drying mat (none are provided)</li>
          <li>
            Preferred soap/dish soap, if you have one. A single, tiny bathroom
            bar soap is all that is provided by the hotel, and only at the
            beginning of your stay. All other soap you have to provide.
          </li>
          <li>Preferred pain/cold meds</li>
          <li>Voice remedies like Singer’s Saving Grace, etc.</li>
          <li>
            Along the same lines, if you like to steam your vocal passages,
            consider bringing your own small steamer, but be aware of any
            electrical concerns (see <a href="#electric">Electrical Concerns</a>
            )
          </li>
          <li>Dried spices/herbs, if you cook a lot</li>
          <li>
            Non-electric coffee-maker option, like a french press or a pourover,
            for those who need coffee from the get-go. The hotel provides an
            electric water kettle but not a coffee maker. (You can also purchase
            cheap, single-cup/multi-cup coffee makers in HK.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Lightweight bowl(s)/mixing bowl (The ones the hotel provides are
            pretty small.)
          </li>
          <li>Can opener</li>
          <li>Wine opener</li>
          <li>
            Coin purse/pouch (Coins are useful and accumulate quickly in HK)
          </li>
          <li>
            Laundry detergent pods, if you have a strong preference in detergent
          </li>
          <li>Preferred vitamins/supplements/protein powder</li>
          <li>
            Paper copy of your Passport/Birth Certificate/SS Card/Driver’s
            License. In the unfortunate event you lose your passport, copies of
            these items can help speed up your process of getting a replacement
            at an embassy/consulate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extra passport photos and US cash. These are useful for traveling in
            the area either during or after the contract. That said, extra
            photos (and a copy of your ID docs, see previous item) could be
            helpful if you lose your passport. And US cash is still a very
            valuable commodity. Always have some extra US cash for an emergency.
          </li>
          <li>HDMI cable for connecting laptop to TV to watch Netflix etc.</li>
          <li>
            A long charging cable for your phone. If you want to keep your phone
            near you while you sleep, outlets can be frustratingly far away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not just good but GREAT walking shoes. You will walk all over the
            place.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compact grocery bags or totes (plastic bags cost extra at most
            grocery stores)
          </li>
          <li>Small tupperware (for packing meals/leftovers)</li>
          <li>
            Extra stick deodorant, if that is your preferred style of deodorant.
            It is hard to find in HK, for whatever reason.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have 3D glasses for viewing IMAX or RealMAX movies, bring
            them! HK cinemas charge a small fee for 3D glasses unless you bring
            your own.
          </li>
          <li>
            Nintendo Switch - there are some Nintendo fans among us, and we know
            this console works pretty seamlessly in HK.
          </li>
          <li>
            PlayStation or XBox - These consoles should work in theory, as long
            as you ensure they can handle the higher 220V voltage of Hong Kong
            and that you have an appropriate adapter for the plug. That said,
            they are bulky and could have compatibility issues, so you'll see
            they're also listed in the next section of items you should probably
            leave at home.

            Chromecasts/Apple TV/Amazon Fire Sticks/Roku/Etc. (They can’t

            Heavy winter wear. It will be in the 60s-80s during October/November
            and will be 50s-70s in December. Leave the snow parka at home. But
            bring layers, a warm scarf, gloves, and a compact fleece or light
            coat for those late December nights when it can still get pretty
            chilly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mass quantities of dress clothes/shoes. Unless you plan to hit the
            clubs in Lan Kwai Fong on the regular or just love wearing nice
            things, you likely won’t wear nice clothes much on this contract.
            98% of the time, we wear comfy, casual clothes--or our costumes. (DO
            BRING at least one 'business-casual,' outfit you can wear on the
            very few occasions when Disney Look is required. Basically anything
            that's not jeans or flip-flops.) So, bring 1-2 nicer outfits, but
            that’s likely all you’ll need.

          Electrical concerns -- Adapters vs. Converters: what do you need?
        </h3>
        <h4 className="special-note">
          What follows is a bit of a crash course in electrics. It is admittedly
          a confusing subject. The tl;dr version is: Save yourself heartache by
          buying cheap HK versions of any appliances you might be thinking of
          bringing. If you must bring your American appliance, you risk frying
          it if is not dual-voltage or if it is not plugged into a capable
          electric converter. Beyond that, you almost certainly want an adapter
          (or two) with USB ports, but know that adapters and converters are not
          the same thing, though you can buy adapter/converter combos.
        </h4>
        <p>
          HK electrical outlets deliver 220V of electrical current and require
          plugs with the UK-style three-prong design.
        </p>
        <img
          id="outlet-plug"
          src="../src/assets/UK-outlet-plug.jpg"
          alt="HK/UK-standard electrical outlets and plugs"
        />
        <p className="img-caption">
          This is the style of electrical outlet and plug you will find in HK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Via use of a travel adapter, you can plug American electric devices
          into these sockets. BUT unless the device is dual-voltage (meaning it
          can handle 220V) you run the risk of overloading it with more voltage
          than the device can handle, potentially frying your item, rendering it
          trash. This is because American single-voltage devices are only built
          to handle the American standard of 110V.
        </p>
        {/* <!--<p>How do you determine whether a device is single- or dual-voltage? You have to look for the electric specs somewhere on the device. Here is what the specs look like on my Magic Bullet blender:</p>
                    <img id="blender" src="" alt="Picture of Magic Bullet Blender">--> */}
        <p>
          You will likely need at least one travel adapter, and adapters are
          easily purchased in many places that sell electronics. An{" "}
          <em>adapter</em>:
        </p>
        <ul className="packing-ul">
          <li>
            adapts your plug so that it will physically fit into a different
            style socket.
          </li>
          <li>does NOT alter voltage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Therefore, simply using an adapter will not protect your American
          device from potentially roasting when it is plugged into the higher
          voltage Hong Kong electical outlet.
        </p>
        <p>
          A voltage <em>converter</em>, on the other hand:
        </p>
        <ul className="packing-ul">
          <li>
            changes voltage from 220V to the American standard of 110V, thereby
            protecting your devices, if the device is within the converter's
            power rating (measured in W, meaning 'watts')
          </li>
          <li>
            are usually heavier, bulkier, and more expensive than adapters.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If finding an acceptable converter sounds like a pain in the butt,
          you're not wrong. I found one in Hong Kong my first year. I used it
          for multiple contracts, but really I was only using it to convert
          voltage for my American-made Magic Bullet blender. Turned out I didn't
          need the converter for my laptop or phone charger, both of which were
          dual-voltage and needed only an adapter. Because I used my blender
          very little last year, I eventually gave away my voltage converter so
          that I wouldn't have to keep lugging around the extra ten pounds each
          contract. Sure, the converter did the job, but it was ten pounds!
        </p>
        <p>
          Appliances are plentiful in HK, and they are easy for us to dispose
          of/give away when the contract is done. There is a glorious store
          called Mini So where I plan to purchase a cheap personal blender this
          year. Single-cup coffee maker, alarm clock, personal scale, bluetooth
          speakers, all manner of small appliances--already calibrated for HK
          voltage--they can all be found in HK fairly easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, after going down the converter route for multiple contracts, I
          have decided to go adapter-only this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, here are some Amazon links to converter/adapter combos that
          some vets have suggested:

            </a>{" "}
            should handle single-voltage electric items with a power rating of
            26-2000W. That covers a lot of hair dryers, but according to its
            safety information, it "CAN NOT work with electronic controlled
            devices that are controlled by digital chips Which has auto

            that has USB ports, but it specifically states that it is not
            compatible with hair dryers or any other device that is above 200W.
            That rules out a lot of medium-to-heavy-duty devices.

        </ul>
        <p className="special-note">
          Deciding whether you need an electrical converter or merely a travel
          adapter depends on what devices you intend to bring with you from the
          US. If they can handle 220V, then an adapter is all you need. If they
          can't handle 220V, you'd have to use a converter that can accommodate
          your device. This means the converter's power rating (26W-2000W, for
          instance) includes that of your device (For instance, my Magic Bullet
          blender generates 150W, meaning it would work with a converter with a
          power rating of 26W-2000W.) You have to check your device's electrical
          label to know how many W it generates.
