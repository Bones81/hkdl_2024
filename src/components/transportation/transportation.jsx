          HK has some of the most efficient and reliable public transportation
          in the entire world.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The train system is known as the 'MTR.' It is extremely modern and
          very easy to navigate, with lots of clear signage and color-coded
          train lines.{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          HK also has a robust public bus system that operates all over the
          territory. There are mulitple bus companies that operate different
          styles of bus routes. Some are large double decker vehicles that
          operate local and express routes covering large sections of HK. Some
          are 14-seat mini-buses that operate more confined routes. And some are
          direct service from one district to another.{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          Ferries are a popular way to move across HK's many waterways. Perhaps
          the most popular one is the Star Ferry across Victoria Harbour, which
          takes you from Central to TST and vice-versa. The cost is stupid
          cheap, and the view is great. You can also use ferries to visit some
          of the popular outlying islands, like Lamma Island or Cheung Chau
          Island.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light rail system is another "lighter" train network (almost a
          cross between trains and trams) that we will encounter a lot near our
          hotel in Tin Shui Wai. It stops more frequently than the MTR trains
          and connects our neighborhood to the nearest MTR station. It is also
          quite cheap and accepts Octopus card payment. Our hotel is located
          adjacent to the 'Ginza' light rail station. From there, it is a short
          trip on the light rail to 'Tin Shui Wai,' where we can connect to the
          larger Tin Shui Wai MTR station.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a fun tram system known as the 'Ding Ding' that operates
          along the northern end of Hong Kong Island. It is extremely cheap, and
          it can be a very fun way to see this vibrant part of HK. Highly
          recommend taking at least one ride on the Ding Ding.

        <h4 className="special-note">
          No one uses the term 'cab' in HK. Only 'taxi.'
        </h4>
        <h4>HK taxis come in three varieties: blue, green, and red.</h4>
        <ul className="trans-ul">
          <li>
            Blue taxis operate only within Lantau Island (where Disney and the
            airport are).
          </li>
          <li>
            Green taxis operate only within the New Territories (basically
            anywhere that isn't on Hong Kong Island, where Central is).
          </li>
          <li>Red taxis operate anywhere in Hong Kong. </li>
          <p className="list-item-p">
            Some taxis prefer to stay near Central and will sometimes refuse to
            take your fare if you want to cross the Harbour. My understanding is
            that this practice is technically illegal, so it often helps to get
            into the taxi before announcing your destination so that they are
            more committed to your fare before they know where they are taking
            you. Even so, some particularly difficult drivers will tell you to
            get out if they really don't want to go to your destination. Again,
            technically illegal, but I leave it up to you how much you want to
            fight with them about it.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Taxis in HK accept cash, and like many vendors, they will often round
          down to the nearest HK Dollar. They sometimes can be short on change,
          so best to have small bills or coins handy so that you can complete
          your transaction. I have never seen a credit card used in an HK cab.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we have early morning or late night rehearsals or performances,
          there will not be a Disney-provided bus to transport us to/from work.
          In those situations, we will take taxis. We generally take turns
          paying the full cab fare.{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>
              Always get a receipt from the driver if you pay for a taxi ride.
            </strong>
          </em>{" "}
          Then you can submit a reimbursement form for that taxi ride. You may
          well submit receipts for several taxi fares at the same time.
        </p>
        <h3>Uber/Ride Share</h3>
        <p>
          While Uber and other ride-share companies operate in HK, they are
          technically banned and not as popular as they are in other major
          cities. This is because HK has one of the best public transportation
          networks in the world and also because taxis in HK are relatively
          cheap compared to taxis in other major cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, one major advantage to using an Uber/ride-share app is that
          your route is pre-determined. There are definitely taxi drivers in HK
          who will try to take advantage of your foreigner naivete by taking an
          extended route to inflate your fare. Using an Uber avoids this
          potential pitfall, though you should know that Uber is technically
          illegal in Hong Kong.
        </p>
        <h3>Walking in HK</h3>
        <p>
          Walking in HK is a workout! Particularly in Central, where the streets
          can be quite steep,{" "}
          <strong>good shoes are extremely important</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pedestrian overpasses take a little while to get used to in HK.
          Ultimately, they keep pedestrians from clogging major vehicle-heavy
          thoroughfares, so they are a huge benefit to the city's overall flow.
          But until you've learned to locate and navigate them, you will
          occasionally find yourself trying to cross an uncrossable street. You
          might have to backtrack until you find the staircase that leads to the
          appropriate pedestrian overpass or 'subway' (which is the term they
          use for a literal 'way underneath something.' Trains are not really
          referred to as 'subways' in HK). Alternatively, you may have to walk
          far away from your intended path to find a crosswalk.
